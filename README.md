The Simple Expense Tracker is a web-based application built using Flask, a lightweight
web framework in Python. The primary goal of this project is to help users manage their
expenses effortlessly by providing a user-friendly interface to record, categorize, and
analyze their spending.

Key Features:
1. User Authentication: Users can register and log in securely to access their
personalized expense tracking dashboard.
2. Expense Entry: Users can add their daily expenses by providing details such as
date, category, amount, and a brief description. This allows for a comprehensive
record of spending habits.
3. Category Management: The application comes with pre-defined expense
categories (e.g., groceries, transportation, entertainment), but users can also
customize categories to suit their specific needs.
4. Expense Overview: Users can view a summary of their expenses, including total
spending, categorized breakdowns, and trends over time. This feature helps users
understand their financial patterns.
5. Search and Filter: Users can easily search for specific expenses or filter their
expenses based on date range, category, or amount. This enhances the
accessibility of their financial data.
6. Budget Setting: The application allows users to set monthly budgets for different
expense categories. It provides notifications or visual cues when users are
approaching or exceeding their budget limits.
7. Report Generation: Users can generate downloadable PDF reports summarizing
their expenses over a selected period. These reports can be useful for financial
planning and analysis
